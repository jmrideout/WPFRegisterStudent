# WPFRegisterStudent
WPF student registry program made with C# for a college project.

This repo is a modification of the ConsoleRegisterStudent project. Instead of being console-based, this solution uses Windows Presentation Foundation. The user can register for courses. However, they cannot register for the same course twice and cannot register for more than 9 credit hours.
